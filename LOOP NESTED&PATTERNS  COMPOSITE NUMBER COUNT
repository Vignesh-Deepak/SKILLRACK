The program must accept an integer N as the input.
The program must print the count of composite numbers upto N as the output.
Note: A composite number is a positive integer that has atleast one divisor other than 1 and itself.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 999
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
9
Output:
4
Example Input/Output 2: 
Input:
27
Output:
17
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
  int N;
  scanf("%d",&N);
  //composite number= it has more than one factor other than 1 and itself eg 4 factor =1,2,4
  //composite number always starts from 2
  for(int ctr=2;ctr<=N;ctr++)
  {
      double sqrtVal=sqrt(ctr); //similar to cumulative prime number
      int compcount=0;
      for(int ctr2=2;ctr<=sqrtVal;ctr2++)//if the number comes from 2 to sqrt of the number then it is composite ,if not then it is prime number
      {
          if(ctr%ctr2==0)
          
          compcount++;
          break; //the for loop
      }
      printf("%d",compcount);
