The program must accept a string S and an integer N as the input.
The program must print the Nth non-repeating character as the output.
Note: The string contains at least N non-repeating characters.
Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= Length of string S <= 100
1 <= N <= 26 
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of string S.
The second line contains the value of N.
Output Format:
The first line contains the Nth non-repeating character.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
HELLO 
3 
Output: O 
Explanation: N = 3, the first non-repeating character is H. The second non-repeating character is E. The third non-repeating character is O. Hence O is printed as the output.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
aaaaabbbcdfecdpqpq 
2 
Output:
e
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int N;
    scanf("%d",&N);  // IMPORTANT N IS NOT FOR SIZE OF STRING , IT IS FOR CHECKING
    char str[101];
    int charcount[128]={0};       // ASCII VALUE OF CHARACTERS VARIES FROM 0 TO 127
    int len = strlen(str);
    for(int i=0;str[i]!='\0';i++)   // or here i<len also can be used
                                   // INCREMENTING IT BY ASSIGNING EACH CHARACTER TO CHARCOUNT ARRAY 
    {
        scanf("%s",str[i]);
        charcount[str[i]]++;
    }
    int nonrepeatchar=0;
    for(int i=0;str[i]!='\0';i++)   // or here i<len also can be used
                                    // AGAIN ITERATING FOR CHECKING 
    {
        if(charcount[str[i]]==1)                         
        {
            nonrepeatchar++; // here non repeated is checked for all characters(string) not for each character eg H(non repeated) nonrepeat=1 ,E(non repeated) nonrepeat=2, L(non repeated) nonrepeat=3, L( repeated) nonrepeat=becomes again 2 from 3 ,0(non repeated) nonrepeat=3   
            if(nonrepeatchar==N)
            {
               printf("%c",str[i]); 
               return 0;
            }
        }
    }
    
return 0;
}

test cases 1
HELLO
charcount[H]++ // initially it is 0
charcount[E]++  
charcount[L]++
charcount[0]++

if(charcount[H]==1)
nonrepeatchar=1
if (nonrepeatchar==N)// N can be any index of the character element for eg here N=1 first non repeatchar=H is printed
if(charcount[E])
nonrepeatchar=2 // imp nonrepeatchar is for total string not for each character // if we check for repeated character we can say it has for each char in a string for that we have to create another string (char array) for reassigning count based on occurence
