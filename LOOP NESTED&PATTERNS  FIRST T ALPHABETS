The program must accept N integers as the input.
For each integer T (among N integers) the program must print the first T lowercase alphabets on each line as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 30
1 <= Each integer value <= 26 (these condition is just to resemble alphabet ->maximum allowed number is 26 after than these it shows error because after than that it contains special characters ,here we dont need to worry because testcase does not exit it)
(if after z again if you want to start with a then you should add %26 to ch
Example Input/Output 1:
Input: 4
8 3 10 1
Output: 
a b c d e f g h
a b c
a b c d e f g h i j 
a
Example Input/Output 2:
Input: 2
15 3
Output:
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o 
a b c

        scanf("%d",currNum);
        while(ch<'a'+currNum)//number can be added to alphabet(ascii) eg here a=97
        {
            printf("%c ", ch);
        }
        ch++;
