Diagonal Constant Matrix 
The program must accept an integer matrix of size RxC as the input.
A diagonal-constant matrix is a matrix in which all the elements in each left diagonal are same.
The program must print YES if it is a diagonal-constant matrix.
Else the program must print NO as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50 
Input Format:
The first line contains the integer values of R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines contain C integers separated by space(s).
Output Format: The first line contains either YES or NO.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input: 3 4
1 2 3 4
5 1 2 3 
9 5 1 2
Output: YES
Explanation:
The left diagonals in the matrix are highlighted below 
1 2 3 4
5 1 2 3
9 5 1 2
Example Input/Output 2:
Input: 4 3 
11 25 65
13 11 25
65 13 11
25 56 13 
Output: NO

// logic - if element in previous row and previous col are same 
int main()
{
    int R,C;
    scanf("%d %d",&R,&C);
    int mat[R][C];
    for(int row=0;row<R;row++)
    {
        for(int col=0;col<C;col++)
        {
            scanf("%d",&mat[row][col]);
            //here since given all elements are in diagonal so no need to check for it
            // 2nd logic if current row does not have any previous row ->that is if it is 1st row it may not have previous row in that case
            if(mat[row][col]!=mat[row-1][col-1]);// ROW -1 IS PREVIOUS
            {
                printf("NO");
            }
            
        }
    }
    printf("Yes");
