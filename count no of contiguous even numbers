test case   2 10 3 4 6 8     
i=0 & i=1 
currcount =1+1;
i=1 & i=2
currcount=2 > max
max=2;
i=2 i =3 (here currcount becomes again 1 because no continuos even no )
currcount 1 > max=2 (false)
i=3 i=4 
currcount =1+1;
i=4 i=5 
currcount 2+1;

here elements ends with even number so,  to find max 
we use ternary in direct printf 
here max=2 ,currcount=3;
